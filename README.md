# LintDB: Late Interaction Database for Highly Relevant Vector Search

Welcome to LintDB, the late interaction database designed to revolutionize vector search with a focus on delivering highly relevant results and interpretability. LintDB is a Rust-based project that aims to provide a production-ready solution for anyone looking to harness the power of late interaction techniques in their applications.

## What is LintDB?

LintDB is not just another database; it's a specialized late interaction database that takes vector search to the next level. Late interaction is a groundbreaking technique that ensures the delivery of precise and contextually relevant results. Whether you're working on recommendation systems, information retrieval, or any application requiring advanced search capabilities, LintDB has got you covered.

## Key Features

### 1. Late Interaction Magic

LintDB employs state-of-the-art late interaction techniques to enhance the relevance of search results. This means you get results that not only match your query but also consider the context, leading to more meaningful and accurate outcomes.

### 2. Production-Ready Stability

Built with Rust, LintDB focuses on providing a robust and reliable solution for production environments. Benefit from Rust's memory safety, concurrency support, and zero-cost abstractions to ensure your vector search is not only powerful but also stable.
