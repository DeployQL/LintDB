LintDB
=========

**LintDB** is a multi-vector database meant for Gen AI. LintDB natively supports late interaction like colBERT and PLAID. 

# Key Features
- **Open Source**: LintDB is released under an open-source license, allowing for community contributions and customization.  
- **Multi vector support**: LintDB stores multiple vectors per document id.   
- **Embedded**: LintDB can be embedded directly into your Python application. No need to setup a separate database.  
- **Full Support for PLAID and ColBERT**: LintDB is built around PLAID and colbert
for efficient storage and lookup of token level embeddings.

# Roadmap

LintDB's mission is to be a full retrieval platform. 

We want to extend LintDB's features to include:
- Snippet highlighting and explainability features.
- Support for more algorithms for retrieval and ranking.
- Increased support for document filtering.
